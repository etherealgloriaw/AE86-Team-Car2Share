# Carpool Application

## Project Description: 

Our app is designed for people who live near the UBC campus. 

It allows people from the same starting point to browse and choose rides on the same route. 

It stores destination addresses and estimated departure time of users and drivers. 

Users can choose the appropriate driver based on the route and departure time to save time and money. 

We can add functionality that allows users to use this app in different places.
