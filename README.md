# Car2Share -- Carpool Application

## Project Summary:

Car2Share is a carpool application for people who need a car ride living in Greater Vancouver. People could publish and view the carpool posts in real-time with other users, and share their previous carpool experiences with others.

The application also contains the map components for users to interact and filter the posts nearby. We hope people without car could hitchhike more and save the energy to protect the environment from now on!

## Project Description:
We store the user information(name, password, phone number) and their trip information(destination, time, number of available seats, home address, price).

Using this data, a user will be able to register and login, and create and edit trips. They could also view their own travel history and other user's real-time posts. The users could also filter the available trips by distance, trip types and number of available seats.

The additional functionality could include automatic matching system according to user's preference and their travel history.
